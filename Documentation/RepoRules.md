2. When a new branch is created is must be assigned to a set of jira tickets.

5. You must create a pull request to merge back into main and must have another team member approve it
6. As the approver for a pull request you are responsible for ensuring the tests are complete and passing
7. The pull request should have the jira tickets the branch completes
